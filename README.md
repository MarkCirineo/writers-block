## Description

This application is a one-stop location for students to organize, outline, and research topics for a paper they are writing. Students can store multiple different projects in their profile and can update them as necessary. The app will create an outline for them as they save their ideas, will provide search options for scholarly articles to further research, and will also help create and format Works Cited into multiple citation formats. After that is done, the app will generate a Works Cited page for the student to copy/paste into their document, ready to go for submission.

Here is a screenshot of the app:
